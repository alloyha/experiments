Continuous and Disjoint Intervals
================================

This project provides functionality to handle continuous and disjoint intervals in Python.


Usage
-----

The project provides a module named `intervals.py` that contains classes and functions for working with continuous and disjoint intervals.

To get started, import the necessary classes and functions in your Python code:

```python
from intervals import ContinuousInterval, DisjointIntervalSet
```

Continuous Intervals
-----

To work with continuous intervals, create instances of the ContinuousInterval class:

```python

# Create a continuous interval [1, 5]
interval = ContinuousInterval(1, 5)

# Access the start and end values
start = interval.start
end = interval.end

# Check if a value is within the interval
is_within = interval.is_within(3)

# Get the length of the interval
length = interval.length()
```

Disjoint Interval Sets
-----

To work with disjoint interval sets, create instances of the DisjointIntervalSet class:

```python

# Create a disjoint interval set
interval_set = DisjointIntervalSet()

# Add intervals to the set
interval_set.add_interval(ContinuousInterval(1, 5))
interval_set.add_interval(ContinuousInterval(8, 10))

# Check if a value is covered by any interval in the set
is_covered = interval_set.is_covered(3)

# Get the union of intervals in the set
union = interval_set.union()

# Get the intersection of intervals in the set
intersection = interval_set.intersection()

# Get the complement of intervals in the set
complement = interval_set.complement()
```

Refer to the module documentation and docstrings for more details on available methods and their usage.

Tests
-----

The project includes a set of tests to ensure the correctness of the interval classes and functions. To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
pytest
```
